Cisco Telepresence Macro to toggle proximity on/off

This Macro enables a user to toggle the proximity feature on/off (or more accurately, adjust the proximity volume from 70 to 0). The main reason for needing to toggle the proximity feature is (typically) for demonstration roooms where you may have numerious endpoints that support proximity.

An example of the user experience on a Cisco DX80 is below. A similar view will appear on a Touch10.
